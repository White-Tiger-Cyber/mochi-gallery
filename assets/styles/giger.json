  "visual_directives": "Biomechanical surrealism inspired by H.R. Giger. A fusion of organic anatomy and industrial machinery. Monochromatic color palette (blacks, greys, cold blues, and metallic silver). Airbrush texture. Intricate details of ribbed pipes, skeletal structures, interconnecting wires, and glossy, slimy surfaces. Eerie, cold, and atmospheric lighting. High contrast. Ancient alien architecture."
