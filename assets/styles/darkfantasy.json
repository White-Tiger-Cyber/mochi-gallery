 "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
  "visual_directives": "Dark fantasy concept art style. Grim, atmospheric, and foreboding. Gothic architecture, ancient crumbling ruins, and mist-covered landscapes. High contrast lighting with deep shadows (chiaroscuro) and volumetric fog. Muted color palette dominated by greys, blacks, cold blues, and deep crimsons. Intricate details, weathered textures, and epic scale. A sense of ancient mystery and danger. Oil painting aesthetic."
