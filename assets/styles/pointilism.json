  "style_name": "Neo-Impressionist Pointillism",
  "visual_directives": "Pointillism painting style inspired by Georges Seurat and Paul Signac. The image must be composed entirely of thousands of small, distinct dots (points) of pure color. No solid lines or sweeping brushstrokes. Optical color mixing where dots blend in the viewer's eye to create form and light. Vibrant, shimmering, and granular texture. Luminous atmosphere with a stippled effect."
