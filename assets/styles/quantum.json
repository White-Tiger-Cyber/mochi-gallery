  "style_name": "Post-Quantum Glitch",
  "visual_directives": "Abstract digital art visualizing post-quantum cryptography. Glitch art aesthetic with data moshing effects and pixel sorting. CRT monitor scanlines, chromatic aberration, and digital noise. Neon wireframe structures dissolving into mathematical chaos. Dark cyberpunk color palette (deep void blacks, neon cyan, electric purple, phosphor green). A mix of structured geometric code and chaotic digital distortion. Visualizing the raw entropy of a blockchain hash."
