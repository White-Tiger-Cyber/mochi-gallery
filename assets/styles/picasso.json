  "style_name": "Picasso Cubism",
  "visual_directives": "Oil painting in the style of Pablo Picasso's Cubist period. Abstract, fragmented geometric forms. The subject should be deconstructed into sharp angles, interlocking planes, and flat shapes. Multiple perspectives shown simultaneously (e.g. looking at objects from the front and side at once). Bold black outlines, distorted proportions, and a palette of earthy ochres, greys, and blues. Avant-garde and surreal."
